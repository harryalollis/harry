    <p>Copper, and brass, for example, all show metallic lustre, as do many other minerals. Minerals with a metallic lustre, such as pyrite, are opaque and shiny. Brass is classified as an element dispite the fact, that in chemical reality, it is a compound. Minerals are solid, naturally occurring inorganic substances that can be found in the earth&#039;s crust. Metals are elementary substances, such as gold, silver and copper that are crystalline when solid and naturally occurring in minerals.</p>

                Tin white (arsenopyrite), steel gray (molybdenite), brass yellow (chalcopyrite), and copper red (native copper). Early intentional brass was actually made with calamine, a mineral which contains zinc. Metals are elementary substances, such as gold, silver and copper that are crystalline when solid and naturally occurring in minerals. Minerals are solid, naturally occurring inorganic substances that can be found in the earth&#039;s crust. Brass could be considered an official mineral if the naturally occurring crystals prove to have a unique structure and chemistry from other copper nickel alloys. The colors of metals or alloys are used as standards for describing the color of ore minerals: Minerals with a metallic lustre, such as pyrite, are opaque and shiny. Brass and bronze, an alloy made from copper and tin, have been made for thousands of years, although brass was often made by accident.
